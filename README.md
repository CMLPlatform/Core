# Core
The CML Django-based platform including all development applications. 
The idea for a platform to visualize, share IE/CML-wide data emerged some years ago and a large proportion of the current code-base dates back to 2017.
Thus bare in mind that many of the "Django apps" are outdated prototype codebases. In view of further potential development parts are currently being updated.

# Overview of apps and folders
* CMLMasterProject: the core of the platform.
* CMS (app): A Wagtail content management system for databases and project overviews. It can potentially also include a blog.
* PUMA (app): An app visualizing material resources embedded in objects in Amsterdam.
* ExioVisuals (app): Visualises ExioBase data. This tool has been surpassed by the developments of the Rama-Scene project see: https://www.ramascene.eu/. 
* MicroVis: (app): An application to showcase interactive visuals related to small project results.
* data:  all data used for MicroVis.
* static, templates: general Django folders.

# Getting started
As mentioned the platform still uses outdated code, at this point in time we don't recommend starting the platform until the platform is updated.
